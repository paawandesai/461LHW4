        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am a UT student majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in
            Entrepreneurship. Outside of academics I am part of a Bollywood fusion dance team called the
            Punjabbawockeez. One of my favorite hobbies is reading, where recently Iâ€™ve delved into mythological
            fiction. I also work in a research lab at UT called the Human Centered Robotics Lab where I helped create a
            proof of concept and a small scale prototype structure for a deployable structural system for seismic hazard
            migration. I have also worked part time during sophomore year at a place called LAITS within UT where I
            provided technical support and assistance to AV installations through the campus buildings. For the next
            couple of years I want to gain experience working in the engineering industry before either getting my MBA
            or masters as well as starting my own business.</p>
